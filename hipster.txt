I .. am a dork .. and sorry. What came out of that truck? Is that truck blood? I'll take my flogging whenever. The great thing about a laxative is that it goes through you so quick that there's room for more laxatives. Forget all of that shit I said just there. If you find me unresponsive at any point, DON'T PANIC. The emergency operator is much more likely to be helpful if you're not hyperventilating / screaming.
